## Overview

This project has 3 sub projects- Phase2, Phase3 and Phase4. The phase1 was related to system setup and hence is not included here, while the requirements are explicitly mentioned in the DEPENDENCIES section in each phase sub-folder.

Phase2 is the implementation of A* algorithm for a rigid robot with no holonomic constraint.

Phase3 is the implementation of A* algorithm for a rigid robot with non-holonocis constraints of a differential drive.

Phase4 is the simulation of Phase3 for a TurtleBot in Gazebo.
